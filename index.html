        <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family
            Felidae and
            often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family.The cat is either a
            house
            cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by
            humans for
            companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
            registries.</p>
        <p>Cats have protractable and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with
            the
            skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the
            ground and
            allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind
            feet.
            Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or
            self-defense,
            climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw
            sheaths when
            scratching rough surfaces.</p>
        <p>Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human
            vision. This is
            partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the
            retina back
            into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim
            light.
            The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration. At low
            light, a
            cat's pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, the domestic cat has rather
            poor
            color vision and only two types of cone cells, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; its
            ability to
            distinguish between red and green is limited. A response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the
            rod
            cells might be due to a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels
            rather than
            representing true trichromatic vision.</p>
